- this is the list w/o villager pictures (which arent technically considered), here are the villager pictures with null characters incase its decided to include them for hundo

Anchovy's Pic - \0
Frobert's Pic - \s
Cesar's Pic - \0
Filbert's Pic - \s

- imo, if we can find a way to type these null characters, i think villager pictures should maybe be added to the run

- looking at the list, i think there is a slight possibilty of this being rta viable with very good luck, considering how many accessories and shirts there are available. don't think i will attempt rta until null stuff is figured out honestly
