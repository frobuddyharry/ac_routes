Any Sunday @ 9am (as long as there are no events during the week)

- Pick train station went you arrive in town (Stage 2)
- Capture map > fill out Stage 4 while doing intros
(LOOK FOR GOLDEN SPOT DURING ALL OF CHORES!)
- During first nook visit, try and fill out Stage 3 (Furniture and Umbrella)

- During letter writing, capture the names and order
- Fill out Stage 1 whenever you can (during help chores or while sending letters), then hit Find Possible Seeds

- When it's finished, hit Refine Possible Seeds in Stage 2, then Get Results in Stage 3
- At this point if the results do not yield a spike or if the spike is below 101 bells, reset.
- If you can potentially get a good spike, select a result and hit Search for Town in Stage 4, do this until you find your map (if it can't find a map on the spike result(s), does that mean you can reset?)

- Finish Chores (make sure to drop all chores items before re-entering)
- Enter 3 Codes

- Buy Shovel and Pay First Debt (might be faster to re-enter nooks now for second debt confirmation)
- Find Money Rock and Golden Spot before talking to Joan (use program to find rock and spot) and follow specific money route depending on the turnip price
