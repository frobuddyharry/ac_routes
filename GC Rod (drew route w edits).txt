Loach
Cherry Salmon
Rainbow Trout
Large Char

The main thing you want here is Loach, you can catch everything else in June 4pm, but Cherry Salmon and Rainbow Trout odds are doubled here. If Large Char is not showing up, just catch it later. Crucian Carp is also nice to grab here because it is a lot more likely than Small Bass.

June 1st 2029 @ 3:45-50pm

The goal here is to catch all required fish and then flip into 4pm to catch fish needed there. This is very precise, and probably won't work but it's worth an attempt if you are trying to be optimal. It might cost a couple seconds but in my opinion I think it's worth it.
You can set time to whatever you want, but I think 3:50-3:45 is the best. 

- If you get all the fish too early, save and quit and go forward to 4pm. 
- If you get all the fish too late, get the 4pm fish first then go back. 
- If you are close and need to kill some time, then catch pond fish or other fish

If you need Large Char, get that now, otherwise get stuff needed here.
You are very likely to get both Dace and Freshwater Goby here, if you somehow do not get them you can get them later in January.

Fish marked with * are better to get during July Night, but they can show up here with slightly smaller percentages.
If you do not get rain, then either pray there is rain during July or go down a year.
