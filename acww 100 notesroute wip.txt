note: ww 100% is seeming unlikely due to items having null characters used for their ids, making lhg impossible for those items. until a way is found to type out these null characters, putting the project on hold :(

THINGS WE KNOW
- max lhg (spamming until u cant anymore) of the music note fills out the entire furniture section of the catalog and some of the shirts, it seems completely impossible to fill out the rest of the catalog.

- you can get both the golden net and golden rod from tortimer by talking to him twice

- even though k.k. songs are in the catalog, they are still needed for 100% imo, cold does it in his 100% us playthrough and it makes sense

- lhg nook upgrades work, but the capacity of items stay the same as nooks cranny, need to test if shop upgrades go in order or go straight to nookingtons!!!!

- for hats/accessories, it seems like you need the lhg the furniture version of them, drop them and pick them up for it to be added to the catalog

- strat might be to have regular nooks by post and then lhg nookingtons by house in a specific spot so its as close as possible

- you can make house clones, whichever clone has the highest upgrade becomes the newest house entry (though the actual house itself inside isnt changed) (cant replicate this right now, there is clearly more to this than i thought)

- if you have two or more of the same house upgrade clone, it takes priority for the first upgrade made

- when doing single lhg for seeds/clones, the only item that matters is the first one, the second one is a stump and third one is a blank item.

- you can still get nook upgrades for the original nooks, meaning u can lhg nookingtons, and still get it originally! not sure if nookingtons is really the way to go for this run, ideally you will get almost everything with lhg to avoid confusion

- おととい (two days ago, song request is both top options in this game)
