CF Net (petaltail gambit)
 
- yes its real ive gotten it before trusttt
- to try > might be worth to just full deforestate in august 5pm, 
then after july 11pm keep 1 tree up per acre... do early winter (Pog) 
and finish chopping on this day and get bagworm (if u can ofc) if centipede 
is last do ONE more check then back it up later (this also allows 
for a more *passive* deforestation if you want while getting 
the axes, seems like you mostly get petaltail after u get 
rid of all ur axes anyways so not sure if putting the time in is worth.
 
2011/12/24 @ 9pm (2047 wiiu)
- house close to nooks
- intros + chores (find 4 flowers) > 2 jingle items 
(top > top, top > bottom)
- sell > buy tools + 3k-4k bell furniture > save
 
2011/12/31
- reset console after save message
 
2012/01/02
- plant hybrid group (one flower per acre, where the corners meet)
- start the axe checks :> and get net if you still need it
 
2011/06/29 @ 9pm
- grab firefly if no rain check nooks
- 30th as needed if rain
- drop bought nooks items
 
2011/07/01 @ 11pm
- begin setup
 
Setup
- check for axes each day until you have 7 axes
- water flowers each day until you get the hybrid
- find july rain days at both 11pm and 4pm
- plant coconuts and have trees setup (forwards 2 day if hybrid is needed, otherwise +4)
	- (i think any more than 7 palm trees is overkill but thats just my thoughts)
 
if you have trouble finding rain go down a year
keep cloudy days in mind... 11pm cloudy could be 3am rain... 4pm cloudy could be 8am rain(?)
 
if there is no 11pm rain whatsoever do 11pm after deforestation UNTIL oak silk > 4pm rain then 7am rain 
(means you do not NEED walking stick)
 
EXTRA (to do while getting axes):
 
7am july checks (check coconut on day before sep)
 
AFTER RAIN DAYS + HYBRID
sep 4:59... daytime as needed to get grasshopper, monarch, and red dragonfly AT LEAST, plus crickets on 5pm
look out for rest of sep stuff though
 
check for double rain day in July as needed
 
JUNE (downwards)
- June stuff early, if you have early coconut this is essential
- all June stuff + peacock if coconuts are ready
- cut down a tree in each acre like the hybrid strat for violin potential
- note: do this visit ONLY if the path to nooks makes it viable (go down or from the sides)
 
2011/12/2 @ 1pm (8am-4pm)
- deforestation until you find bagworm + check shop
- listen for early mole cricket
 
2011/08/11 @ 5pm
- finish deforestation and catch all bugs
- scare away all tree bugs and keep eye out for petaltail
