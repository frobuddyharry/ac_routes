gc rod (the route of all time)

TAS only, but maybe not? Only does 4 dates but in order to make it work you have a time limit for both Jellyfish and Giant Catfish, but still ties the main route in date changes if missed! February needs to be inspected to find the most optimal date where you don't lose as much Stringfish % but Loach is still easily obtainable.
