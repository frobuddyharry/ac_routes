Saturday @ 8pm...

Two Days Ago

NOTES AND THOUGHTS:

-- = looked into and routed in or doesnt work
(!!!) = need to route in

Harvest Moon Festival --
- my idea is to do double september for day and night like in the net route, but get the candy later, only issue is the raffle, so maybe during codes hell get ant and the net? AUTUMN MEDAL >:( would need to do some weird routing 

Christmas --
- make one of the extra characters during 4 chores a girl, then get both the toy car and dolly allowing for 3 extra codes

Christmas During Nookway/Train Dupe/Golden Axe --
- this should eliminate extra date changes

Sale Day Strats (also during earlier segments) --
- getting the market model during sale day, but potentially just opening the final grab bags on the way to the fountain and dropping the items instead of selling?

Big Dot Shirt --
- after get the items from the police station, equip first shirt obtained (assumes you collected shirts then the furniture) 

Spring Medal --
- potentially get spring medal during march? im not sure if it aligns at all unfortunately but still a thought

December Bugs/Fish In Codes Hell --
- instead of going to jan/feb, you can do december codes hell bugs/fish

January vs. February (obsolete) --
- it might be better to do one of these months depending on events and items, the odds are the same for both months i think?
- january has new years > random diary + fortune letter
- february has groundhog day > random flower model

New Years Strats (not doing) --
- you can get the noisemaker at 1am on january 1st then the other items at 6am, will this work? others items work as normal, noisemaker is the only outlier because nooks wont be open (nook n go closes at 11pm, reward is available at 11pm, potential?)

Sending Fossils -- 
- this could be stupid, but i truly do feel like sending some fossils in is good! likeliness for dupes are low, so during gyroid digging i feel like you should keep and send fossils to potentially save 1 or 2 s&q
- I think the current idea is after digging, keep 3 fossils, mail them off the next day, then grab them the day after, theoretically saving 3 codes!

November Strats --
- november is ideal for bagworm, and also has police and well models to nab, but im 99% sure fish are bad here or dont show up, but what about december??! (also could delay bagworm, then during codes hell replace one of the december visits with november to nab it

Bottle Rocket --
- during the pinwheel/balloon/fan stuff, get the bottle rocket from tortimer? his location is unfortunately random so that could be an issue

Multiple Model Strat (!!!)
- during february for groundhog day, you could get multiple different models by going in on multiple characters, same with town day, but unless a way to find the town day without painfully looking through each day is found, seems unlikely + getting the no music code models would make it rather pointless if you do get unlucky (Update: i forgot you can literally look in the diary for the date LMAO, town day might be good still, but if you get dupes its bad, so kind of a gamble)

- Update: looking back on this, this has huge potential during the player statues segment I didn’t realize, so I would like to route this in for town day and Groundhog Day… the only issue is concerning town day, because of the use of model codes in the runs beginning segment to remove the music… I will look into 7f codes again to see what I can do, ideally I can generate some new codes for equally expensive items so duplicates are less likely to happen

- Update2: brian has already generated 5 7f codes for models that arent train station LFG will route this in this is so cool very happy :D i think its funnier to check town day during the very beginning and lose 2 transitions but i like the idea more, would lose like half a second in a day long category so who really cares

Nookingtons Reset --
- recently saw that nicks former all nook upgrades run resets before going on the train and still gets nookingtons, so this is a pretty big timesave 

Stationary --
- instead of consistently marking stationary, will be better to delay it til near the ending, you will get a lot of different stationary from villager codes

House/Manor Model (not doing) --
- need to see if these 2 items will show up or not during a normal run, would save codes but i doubt itll work for either... and placing items to get it is probably not at all worth it, and if it does it would not save a lot of time
- i think this can work with e-reader cards? but i wont be using those

Explorer's Day x Harvest Moon Festival (not doing) --
- theres an EXTREMELY small chance that these both align at some point and would be fast to switch from 6:59pm to 7pm or smth like that?? this needs to be looked into though cuz i cant really tell from just looking at the sheets (Update: nope)

Fishing Tourney x Father's Day --
- june 15th 2025 is both fathers day and fishing tourney, could this work during codes hell segment/other events and stuff?
- this doesnt seem to work, afaik he onlys give you the fathers day item, and it you need to reload to get it i dont think its worth it

First Debt During Other Chores --
- drop some money bags and leave them do to first debt during this segment???

P4 Perfect Town --
- will be more optimal to do the perfect town on p4 at the end, avoid a date change?

Full Clear Carpet/Wallpaper ASAP
- i think that this could be ideal to do depending how many you have left after getting all "special" carpets/wallpapers. i think that this makes sense and would save time in the long run compared to checking the carpet/wallpaper section for the last few...
there are 88 carpets/wallpapers that are available in nooks, 44 each, i think when you get down to either the final 16 or final 8 it is worth it to prioritize doing codes for them.

Fast Nook Codes > Magazine Codes @ Nooks (not doing) --
- when you do a magazine code at nooks, you lose about 2 seconds(?), and this time does add up over the run. it would be a good bit faster to use the nook codes instead and use magazine codes only for letters

Delay Police Station First Check --
- it could be better to potentially delay the first police station check by a couple days, specifically after you donate bugs/fish, this wouldnt really eliminate the 2nd entry you do in halloween unless you delayed until that point, which still might be worth to delay until then...
- so this could be good? but instead just delaying until halloween and not doing 2 trips... so heres how it maths out
everytime you go forward a day, you have a 50/50 chance that an item will spawn (from your common list i think... not sure) in the police station, and before halloween you go forward like 4 times??? so i think this makes a good amount of sense! next time you'd check this is during extra bridge and at that point you already wouldve have a lot of items so not sure if its a worthwhile check, will look into this during practice run

Delay Other Player Chores (not doing) --
- this would be a decent time save (in terms of hundo) for the villager codes, for every code post adding another player you must rotate around to the villager names which loses about .6 - 1 second, so thats about 4-5 seconds probably each time you mail letters... so in codes hell only you lose about 4-5 minutes :/ but you kinda need to do this at some point, question is how long can this be delayed? also can extra bridge be better in early game now that villager codes are good now? this will also delay toy day items, not golden axe though, unless you would do it before extra bridge
- while i do really want to route this in, i also really dont... delaying aps and doing golden axe with an extra date change just kinda sucks, and i dont think it saves as much as you'd think due to not having to scroll down 4 times on the last 2 letters and just going the other way on the wheel and selecting the bottom two, so its probably 5 minutes saved total in the entire run which for such a major and kind of annoying reroute, not worth it enough for me, someone else can route this in along with nook codes @ nooks.

2nd Town Tortimer + Candy --
- visiting tortimer on Labor Day after second town chores and getting the shop model, then buying candy as the nookingtons item and dropping it for p1 to catch ant right afterwards. should be pretty fast? but might be weird to route in.
- current idea is to do october 29th instead of december 28th > do labor day (sep 2nd 2030?) on file 2 > get shop model and travel to main town > buy candy as item (IF POSSIBLE! dont know if this will trigger the upgrade and need to test!) and drop it outside along with everything else from earlier > catch ant :> then pickup and sell all the items...? you go forward to october 31st so this wont quite work, will have to sell the next day BUT this guarantees no rain (for ant) AND a potential jack item!? probably not even worth it but ig if u run into him somehow pray its not a dupe if u have spooky items
- candy doesnt work for the upgrade, still can buy and drop candy just have to buy another item

route is currently undergoing some major changes for now
