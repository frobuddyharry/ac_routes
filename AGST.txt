+7 days 4/30/2000 @ 8pm

- get golden shovel and drop normal shovel, buy stuff if needed and setup the town
- water any wilted flowers you see, and pick every weed
	- each acre is 16x16, and it seems the edges DO NOT overlap…
	- trees - when freeballing, DO 14!!!, with a MAX of 6 in each quarter-acre (no more will grow, u need 12-15 trees)

	- flowers?! Plant them along edges of houses, right next to trees, ramps (i.e. places where trees won’t grow anyway). Put them in groups of three to make watering easier. Try to do 3 per acre
	- CHECK FOR SILVER SHOVEL AFTERWARDS (+1 day)

- 5/1/2000
	- Run around checking dead trees, and noting the number of trees in each acre (if you want to be safe). pull weeds, water any wilting flowers
	- AT THE END, talk to pelly to check town rating (first option)
		- if it’s two exclamation points at the end, good! Check for silver shovel and go on (+7 days) Otherwise, fix it…

- 5/8/2000 (check nooks now for silver tools + shovel? (and buy flowers))

- keep doing the same loop of checking the shop, getting flowers, checking resetti for silver shovel, and trying for axe.
- once you are on your way to get the 49th and 50th flowers, get mail 
- Go forward a day to get mail for silver watering can

- once u have gotten all three non-shop silver tools, hybrid and coconut, u can begin the net and rod portion of the run
	- during bugs and fish, you can look for the 3 shop silver tools by checking bugs/fish, checking shop, then going down a day (up a day after bugs are done?)

7/16/2030 @ 3:04am (go to XX:X4 everyday and get balloon very first thing)
